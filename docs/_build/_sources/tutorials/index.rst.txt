Tutorial
========

Analysis of ``celloracle`` proceeds through multiple steps below.
Please run the notebooks following the order. If you do not have ATAC-seq data and want to use default genome and TF binding information, you can skip the first and second step and start from the third step.
Please refer to the ``celloracle`` paper for detailed information.


You can download all notebooks from `here <https://github.com/KenjiKamimoto-wustl122/CellOracle/tree/master/docs/notebooks>`_ .
