Tutorial
========

Analysis of ``celloracle`` proceeds through multiple steps below.
Please run the notebooks following the order. If you do not have ATAC-seq data and want to use default genome and TF binding information, you can skip the first and second step and start from the third step.
Please refer to the ``celloracle`` paper for detailed information.


You can download all files and notebooks from  `celloracle  git hub page <https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cicero-release/>`_
